# Basketball-Simulator
Simple text-based basketball game simulator.

Includes customizable game settings (quarters/halves, game time, average scoring rate). I haven't gotten around to implementing team settings yet.

A similar (better) project with a UI can be found here: https://github.com/colepetersen22/BasketballSimulator
